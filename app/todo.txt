TODO #1. Checked checkbox remains unchecked after screen rotation - (If you create custom adapter, listView.setItemChecked(i, true)
    is not working for custom adapter, you have to implement CheckableRelativeLayout )

TODO #2. Unify Phone number format


SOLVED PROBLEMS:
1. Import from contacts photo isn't displayed - Permission Denial Exception
    Use api < 23 and ask for permission in manifest. Above API 23 you need to grant permission in code during runtime.

2. Can't delete newly added contact from the database
    When you add a new contact to the database you have to assign an id to it
